# Canons Pilates

Canons Pilates is a fictional Pilates Centre located in Edgware, North West London, UK. The current process in the way they are looking to place bookings for classes needs to be completely changed and adjusted with the use of a functional and user-friendly website.

The website created for them is a four-page website enabling students and potential students with the passsinate interest of taking up Pilates. Benefits Pilates will bring to their physical and mental health, well being and day to lives. Easily navigate to the type of classes available, when the classes are available and the cost of each class. The site provides its main objective with the ability to book a class online and receive a confirmation message.

INFORMATION TO FOLLOW  

#### **Structure** 
 
The structure of the site is informed by the scope, user and business goals as well as the principles of IXD (interaction design) to make sure I was conforming to user’s expectations and making everything as intuitive as I could. 
 
The site has a simple structure made up of 3 page links from the Navigation bar: 
* Homepage – A  Carousel with four images of pilates classes 
* Classes - more detailed information about the type of classes for students. 
* Book Us - information about booking the band and a booking enquiry form. 
* There is also 1 additional sub page; 
    * A thank you confirmation page for when a user has submitted the form to book a class. 
    The site has a navbar which remains fixed to the top of the page on desktop, tablet and mobile i this allows a user to access any page they need at any time and would be suitable for a returning visitor who knows exactly where they want to go. There is also a footer on every page with quick links to all pages,  the company pilates social media sites used and a booking button 
 
There is also another method of navigation, a preferred pathway through the site via ‘Quick Links’ located at the footer of all pages, enabling a first time user through the content. This is designed primarily for students who want to book a class their preferred running class.

####**Fonts** 

I imported [Google Fonts]  with the google fonts imported link on each page ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&family=Macondo&display=swap') 

I used the Inter Sans-Serif as the primary font and Mocando Cursive as the Secondary font as a backup in case the primary font failed. I found the Inter Sans-Serif font is a user-friendly, outstanding and clean typeface that contributes the design. I love the way letters A, M and W stand out in each heading. I was inspired by using the Inter Sans-Serif font when I completed the BoardWalk Games site using on the Code Institute learning management system module. https://jmodi16.github.io/boardwalk-games/ 

 

-   ### Features 
    * Responsive on all device sizes from 260px 
 
    -   #### Navigation Bar 
        * The responsive navigation bar has been applied to all three pages so that the pages are uniform, which is more visually appealing and improves user experience. It is also 'sticky' so that it is visible at all times no matter where the user is on the webpage. The navigation bar includes clear links to the Home, Classes, Contact Us and Book Now pages. 
The navigation section promotes ease of use for the user, allowing the user to move easily between sections and pages.

-   #### Hero Images 
        * There is a striking hero image on the homepage to attract the attention of the user. Hero image displays a typical hero performing a superb pilates asana.It is in a circular format, with Pilates labelled twice around the image. Unfortunately, the hero image in only visible on the Home page of the navbar and title bar, not displayed on any other pages.
