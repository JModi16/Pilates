# Canons Pilates

Canons Pilates is a fictional Pilates Centre located in Edgware, North West London, UK. The current process in the way they are looking to place bookings for classes needs to be completely changed and adjusted with the use of a functional and user-friendly website.

The website created for them is a four-page website enabling students and potential students with the passsinate interest of taking up Pilates. Benefits Pilates will bring to their physical and mental health, well being and day to lives. Easily navigate to the type of classes available, when the classes are available and the cost of each class.

#### **Wireframes** 

INFORMATION TO FOLLOW  

#### **Structure** 
 
The structure of the site is informed by the scope, user and business goals as well as the principles of IXD (interaction design) to make sure I was conforming to user’s expectations and making everything as intuitive as I could. 
 
The site has a simple structure made up of 4 page links from the Navigation bar: 
* Homepage – A  Carousel with four images of pilates classes 
* Classes - more detailed information about the type of classes for students. 
* Book Us - information about booking the band and a booking enquiry form. 
* There is also 1 additional sub page; 
    * A thank you confirmation page for when a user has submitted the form to book a class. 
    The site has a navbar which remains fixed to the top of the page on desktop, tablet and mobile i this allows a user to access any page they need at any time and would be suitable for a returning visitor who knows exactly where they want to go. There is also a footer on every page with quick links to all pages,  the company pilates social media sites used and a booking button 
 
There is also another method of navigation, a preferred pathway through the site via ‘Quick Links’ located at the footer of all pages, enabling a first time user through the content. This is designed primarily for students who want to book a class their preferred running class.

To Follow ! 
 


### **Fonts** 

I imported [Google Fonts]  with the google fonts imported link on each page ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100..900&family=Macondo&display=swap') 

I used the Inter Sans-Serif as the primary font and Mocando Cursive as the Secondary font as a backup in case the primary font failed. I found the Inter Sans-Serif font is a user-friendly, outstanding and clean typeface that contributes the design. I love the way letters A, M and W stand out in each heading. I was inspired by using the Inter Sans-Serif font when I completed the BoardWalk Games site using on the Code Institute learning management system module. https://jmodi16.github.io/boardwalk-games/

- #### Error 404 page
A error 404 page was created in the event that the page failed to load due to a broken link, page removed, connectivity issue. Once the error 404 is loaded, it enables them to navigate back to the home page.

### **Features For The Future**
* In the future a 'Book Online' feature will be implemented and marketed encouraging student users to directly book their Pilates classes online rather than sending a booking enquiry by email  or needing to speak to a member of the Pilates team. This should improve user experience as they can more efficiently book classes.
* We would like the Booking system within the Book-Now page to alert the users should classes be full and show availability for next classes, within an integrated calendar based system.
* We would also like a payment system implemented on the booking-now system, enabling the user to enter card details and system connected to an online payment merchant. Currently, payment is made when arriving at the Pilates centre.

* We hope to have a mobile app on the Apple store and google play store to be downloaded very soon, enabling efficient booking and availability.
* FAQ page- this would be beneficial to the customer to view answers to commonly asked questions for more insight into our Pilates.
